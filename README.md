## Stealth\-Chat a File Chat program


</div>

### Description

This is a file chat program that lets users chat to each other without the aid of ip addresses and winsock controls, all it needs is the location to a shared area on your network where the room files will be created then every one else enters that address in there program and then you are able to chat to each other. This program also contains static rooms that you can go to so you dont have to stay in the same room all the time.

Also by the press of a button it changes into a replica of notepad in case any one comes along that might not like you chatting.It worked in my school...lol!!

PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.
